Eventually there will be a goal to have user select how long they want their code to be (3-6 numbers)

Needs to track:
    --Solution 
        --a 5 number string
    --past guesses
        -- an array of past guesses
        --each past guess is an array of number objects [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]
        --each object represents a letter in the guess word {key: '3', color: 'green'}
    --current guess
        --string '24012'
    --keypad numbers
    --number of turns
        -- an integer 0-6 (or however many turns is decided)

Game Process:
    --entering numbers
        --user enters a number (5 digits lets say) and each tile is filled with a digit
        --when a user hits delete it deletes the previous digit
        --when a user hits enter it submits the number 
            --if all tiles are not filled then the number is not sumbitted
            --if that guess has already been made it will not be submitted (guesses array will be needed)
        --checking submitted words:
            --each number is checked to see if it matches to the Solution
            --each number is assigned a color based on it's inclusion in the Solution
                --exact matches are green (correct position)
                --partial matches are yellow (in solution but wrong position)
                --if the digit is not in the puzzle it will be grey
            --the guess is added to the grid with the correct colors
            --current guess moves to the next row (x amount of rows, dependent on how many guesses is decided)
            --numpad numbers are updated (colors) so 0-9 digits will be shown bottom of screen  
        --ending the Game:
            --when the guess matches solution
                -- animation of a lock unlocking 
                -- confirm the user got it and show them how many guesses it took and the color of their tiles
            --run out of guesses
                --show their guess history with color of tiles and say 'Better Luck next time!'

--Things to handle
    --'75432' is the solution and you guess '75543' 5 would show green for the first 5 and yellow for 2nd 5 where it should show GREY for the 2nd 5
    --popup to explain how to play the game everytime you start
    --victory screen
    --loss screen
    center middle of screen
